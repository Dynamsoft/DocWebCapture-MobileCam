## System Requirements

DWC requires the following features to work:

- Secure context (HTTPS deployment)

  When deploying your application / website for production, make sure to serve it via a secure HTTPS connection. This is required for two reasons
  
  - Access to the camera video stream is only granted in a security context. Most browsers impose this restriction.
    > Some browsers like Chrome may grant the access for `http://127.0.0.1` and `http://localhost` or even for pages opened directly from the local disk (`file:///...`). This can be helpful for temporary development and test.
  
  - Dynamsoft License requires a secure context to work.

- `WebAssembly`, `Blob`, `URL`/`createObjectURL`, `Web Workers`

  The above four features are required for the SDK to work.
